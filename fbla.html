			  <ul>
				<li>We have an application deadline of late October (Too late to join for the 2022-2023 year).</li>
				<li>A considerable amount of commitment is needed, members should come to every meeting possible. Additionally, members need to commit time towards traveling for their competitions, which are held at locations other than Union such as Lower Columbia college or Spokane.</li>

      <p>Competitions are events where FBLA members compete against other members from different schools in a wide variety of topics. These events can range from individual tests that are related to a business subject, to group project events where members create a video game or a marketing video, then show it to judges and explain the business centered process behind creating it. The events can even include presentations or case study/role-acting events, where members give a presentation or act out a business scenario in front of judges. All these topics and event types cover a wide array of business concepts, so no matter what you're best at, there's always an event to suit it.</p>
      <p> Competitions also give members the ability to travel, and are divided into 3 levels: Regional, State and National. Members travel to a local school for the regional competition, and come back later that same day. If a member places within the top four of any of their events at the regional competition, they get to travel to the state competition. At the State level, members spend multiple days in a city like Seattle or Spokane, competing against other members from the entire state of Washington. When not competing, members can tour the cities but must come back to their hotel rooms each night before curfew. Finally, if a member places within the top four at their state competition, they have the option to compete Nationally. National conferences contain all the top placing members in the country and are held in different states every year. Members will fly to their destination if they choose to compete at the national level, and will travel with the rest of their qualifying high school members. Like the state competition, members get to tour the city when not competing but must exercise safety at all times.</p> 
      <p>At each level of competition, awards and recognition are given to the top four winners of each event. Union's own membership saw 14 people qualify and travel to the national competition in 2022, meaning 35% of the club made it to the most competitive competition, earning recognition, awards and leadership experience at each level. The point is, even if competing nationally seems like an insurmountable task, many of our own club members at Union have, and with effort from a member, it's entirely possible to get that far.</p>
      <p> Fundraiser opportunities are also present throughout the year to alleviate some of the financial costs competitively-qualifying members must pay for hotels and traveling fees.</p>
